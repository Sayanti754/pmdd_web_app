- Underlying mental health conditions
- Lifestyle factors such as stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, and inadequate sleep
- Conditions like **PCOS, thyroid disorders**, or **family history** of mood disorders

 🧪 Diagnosis
PMDD is diagnosed based on symptom tracking over two or more menstrual cycles, using tools like:
- Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)
- Standardized screening questionnaires

 💊 Management and Treatment
Treatment options include:
- Lifestyle changes (regular exercise, sleep, and balanced diet)
